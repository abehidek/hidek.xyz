        <h1><span>About me</span></h1>
        <p>I'm a tecnology enthusiast, student and software developer, born in Brazil.</p>
        <p>I started in the field about 5 years ago when I entered high school which had an informatics course that I've joined.</p>
        <p>That course taught me basic concepts such as algorithms and markup languages like html.</p>
        <p>However, at the end of the course, I needed to develop and show my final project, in which I've had to learn other technologies to execute my idea, that's when I really decided to continue pursuing this field.</p>
        <p>Python and JavaScript are my main languages however, I plan to master some interesting languages like Rust, Haskell and Elixir.</p>
        <p>I'm also, currently in love with Linux and the FOSS community, and my main distros are NixOS and Arch.</p>
        <p>I'm constantly searching something new to do, I enjoy consuming content like articles, documentaries, books and videos, sometimes I play video games and most of the time I'm browsing the internet. I'm fascinated with history, physics, math and other fields of knowledge.</p>
        <p>I understand both Portuguese and English, currently learning Japanese.</p>
