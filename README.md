My personal website

## Definitions
- fully dark mode
- same font for everything
- content > features
- each publication is an article, which are defined in the /content folder

## Ideas
- do some security stuff (paraxia.io) to not explore app
- add liveview components such as like, view count, presence
- mdx or web-components inside content articles
- rss.xml generated automatically
- use turso as sqlite db and change deploy from fly.io to another host plataform (for better speed)
- japanese ideagram seems cool to add
- embbed 3D model using blender? and three.js
- blurred image placeholder?
